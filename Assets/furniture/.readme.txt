Thank you for downloading my office interior pack!

I created this based on the style of offices and police stations of the 50s and 60s - kind of like Twin Peaks. I hope you enjoy!

This version of the pack contains:

- Benches (2 variants)
- Coat hanger
- Coat (2 variants)
- Cupboard
- Drawers
- Thin drawers
- File cabinet
- Tables (2 variants)
- Lightswitch (on and off)
- Paper stack
- Taped boxes (small and large)
- Large safe
- Wall/floor made of boards, tileable
- Lampshade
- Phone
- Mug (w/steam in a separate sprite)

All furniture listed above also come in "clean" and "noisy" versions.

This pack will probably see updates in the future, so message me or comment on the download page if you want to request a specific addition.
